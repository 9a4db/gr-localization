A-prio: fix OSM!!! (no idea why it does not work --> Johannes)
- adjust manuels code; clean up own
- header explanation for selfloc logs
- plot anchors -> use like all other positions
- rename receiver --> sensor
- rename setting_calibration in gui or maybe not?
- homogenous name convention
- general code cleanup:
  ->remove dangerous scalar operators if np is used!
- speed of light parameter instead of hardcoding
- restart --->> same delays ?
- calibration for self-localization
- memory lack/overuse
